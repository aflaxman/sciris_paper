# Summary 
Sciris is a cohesive collection of tools that enables simple
interaction with foundational libraries from the scientific Python
ecosystem(e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`), as well as with
libraries of broader scope, such as `multiprocessing` and `pickle`. The
purpose of Sciris is to facilitate and accelerate the development and
delivery of easy-to-use domain-specific scientific software. This is
achieved by providing classes and methods that simplify the interface to
frequently used functionality which, while essential for the development of
robust software applications, diverts focus from the actual problem being
solved. Some of Sciris' key features include: ensuring consistent
dictionary, list, and array types (e.g., enabling users to provide inputs
to a class or method as either lists or arrays); enabling ordered
dictionary elements to be referenced by index; simplifying datetime
arithmetic by allowing users to provide either a date string or a datetime
object; simplifying the saving and loading of files and complex objects;
and, simplifying the parallelisation of common operations. Sciris makes
writing scientific code in Python faster, more pleasant and more readable
for a diverse non-specialist audience. This means that with Sciris users
can get more done with less code, without the need to reinvent the wheel,
and spend less time looking things up on StackOverflow (or the other 20+
tabs with the documentation of every single library your new application is
built upon). Further, Sciris offers an extension to build webapps in
Python: ScirisWeb. In contrast to Plotly Dash and Streamlit, which have
limited options for customization, ScirisWeb is modular, so users can
control which subset they use for a project. 

The name Sciris, a combination of Scientific + Iris (Greek word for
"rainbow"), thus honors the wide spectrum of tasks commonly required in the
 development of scientific computing applications.

# Statement of need
<!-- 
  Maybe reduce this section.
 -->
With the increasing availability of large volumes of data and computing
resources, scientists across multiple fields of research have been able to
tackle increasingly complex problems. But to harness these resources, the
need to develop and use domain-specific software has become a ubiquitous part
of scientific projects. Commensurate with the complexity of problems, these
software-related activities have also become increasingly complex, creating a
steep learning curve and an increasing burden of code review
[@burden-codereview]. 

<!-- NOTE: find a paper of papers where they do a survey of the state of scientific code production, to justify the 
  "large fraction"
 -->
The current reality of scientific code production is that any workflow
(e.g., either a full cycle in the development of a new software library, or
in the execution of a one-off individual analysis) very often relies on
multiple codebases, including but not limited to: low-level libraries;
domain-specific open-source software; and self-developed and/or inherited
swiss-army-knife toolboxes -- whose original developer may or may not be
around to pass on undocumented wisdom. Several scientific communities have
adopted collaborative, community-driven, open-source software approaches due
to the significant savings in development costs and increases in code quality
that they afford [@kerr2019epidemiology] (e.g., astropy
[@robitaille2013astropy], nilearn [@nilearn] and fmriprep
[@esteban2019fmriprep]). Despite this progress, a large fraction of
scientific software efforts remain a solo adventure, leading to proliferation
of tools that reinvent the wheel. 

<!-- NOTE: astropy and nilearn get a mention here because of their scale 
and the size of the core dev team. There are other libraries such as seaborn and pingouin that are also open-source projects, but still are heavily developed and maintained by a single developer -->

Scientific software differs from commercial production software in that it is
a crucial component in the elaboration of scientific conclusions, and as such
it should be: re-runnable, repeatable, reproducible, reusable, and
replicable [@benureau2018re]. A key aspect to ensure these properties is
readability of tutorials, documentation and especially of code itself. But it
is essential to note that programming abstractions may not be a great way to
express human-readable scientific ideas, which is what scientific code should
convey (e.g., one would not include the user manual of a spectrophotometer
as part of a report on protein analysis). 
<!-- NOTE(SAK): not sure how the (eg. ...) is an example of the preceding sentence -->

There are several notable libraries that follow this "simplifying interfaces"
approach to letting researchers focus their time and efforts on solving problems,
prototyping solutions, deploying applications and educating their
communities. Some of these include PyTorch, seaborn
[@waskom2021seaborn], DataLad [@halchenko2021datalad], pingouin
[@vallat2018pingouin], hypothesis [@maciver2019hypothesis], Mayavi
[@ramachandran2011mayavi] and PyVista[@sullivan2019pyvista], just to name a
few though there are many more. As an example, PyTorch
has become popular in academic and in research environments
by making models easier to
write compared to TensorFlow [@pytorch-research]. 

Why do we need Sciris then? Sciris traces its origins to 2014, initially
created to support development of the Optima suite of models
[@kerr2015optima]. Among the existing libraries at the time we had not
found one that simplified the complex semantics of powerful containers
or the parallelisation of trivial yet data-intensive operations. In our work,
we kept encountering the same inconveniences over and over while building
scientific webapps, and so began collecting the tools we used to overcome
them into a shared library. While Python was and still is considered an easy-to-use language for beginners, the motivation that shaped Sciris' evolution was to further lower the barriers to access, interact with, and orchestrate the numerous
supporting libraries we were using. 

We confirmed our endeavor had paid off when in early 2020 the combination of brevity
and simplicity provided by Sciris was crucial in: (i) the faster-than-average
development of Covasim [@kerr2021covasim; @kerr2022python]; and (ii) enabling
Covasim to become one of the most widely adopted COVID models, used by
students, researchers and policy makers alike. In addition to Covasim, Sciris
is currently used in a number of scientific applications
[@kedziora2019cascade; @atomica; @fraser2021using; @hiptool; @synthpops; @parestlib]
and since 2022 has been designated as a critical project on the Python
Package Index (PyPI).

The current stable version of Sciris includes implementations of heavily used
code patterns and abstractions that facilitate the development and deployment
of complex domain-specific scientific applications, regardless of their scope
and scale, and further enables non-specialist audiences to interact with
these complex applications. Sciris "stands on the shoulders of giants", and
as such is not intended as a replacement of those, but rather as a strongly
idiomatic scientific crucible that will result in a more effective and
sustainable development process for solo-developers and teams alike, and
hopefully it will help increasing the longevity [@perkel2020challenge] of new
scientific libraries. Sciris is actively developed and maintained. We note
that ScirisWeb, while functional, is still in beta development.

<!-- This may sound paradoxical -->
<!-- Sciris is domain-specific in the sense that it has been mostly developed by
researchers to be used by researchers. However, within the scope of scientific
software Sciris is domain-general because it can be used to develop
libraries for different research domains such as physics,
neuroscience or epidemiology.  -->


# Example
<!-- (perhaps mention a few of the libraries/dependencies) -->
The Sciris library offers a coordinating interface to multiple well
established and highly flexible Python libraries. Writing a script that
directly uses multiple of these underlying libraries can obscure the key
logic of the scientific problem. Whereas the Sciris interface keeps the focus
on the science.

For instance let us imagine that we want to randomly sample numbers from a
user-defined smooth function. In addition, we want to repeatedly draw numbers
for multiple levels of noise, and save these results in separate files. At a
later stage, we would like to load the independent files, "glue" them
together to reconstruct a surface embedded in 3D by interpolating the random
samples; and finally, we want to plot the random points and surface together.
Parallelizing the repeated draws and customizing the axes to render the 3D
scatter plot plus mesh can be quite cumbersome. The example 
\autoref{fig:showcase-code} presents two functionally identical scripts and
 highlights that the one written with Sciris is much more succinct and
 readable:

# Overview
Sciris has been designed to provide class- and function based implementations
of common operations ranging from merging ordered dictionaries, to providing
simplified interfaces to datetime arithmetic, and to limiting the execution
of a program based on resource usage irrespective of the operating system or
computational environment where the application is executed. 



ScirisWeb provides a ''just works'' solution using [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) as the web framework, [Redis](https://redis.io/) for the (optional) database and Matplotlib/[mpld3](https://github.com/mpld3/mpld3) for plotting. ScirisWeb  also enables users to use a React (ref) frontend linked to an SQL database with Plotly figures, ScirisWeb can serve as the glue holding all of that together.

moving average, rolling mean, rolling average, convolution  -->
