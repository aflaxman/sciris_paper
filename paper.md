# Summary 
[Sciris](https://github.com/sciris/sciris) is a cohesive collection of tools
that enables simple interaction with foundational libraries from the
scientific Python ecosystem(e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`), as
well as with libraries of broader scope, such as `multiprocessing` and
`pickle`. The purpose of Sciris is to facilitate and accelerate the
development and delivery of easy-to-use domain-specific scientific software.
This is achieved by providing classes and methods that simplify the interface
to frequently used functionality which, while essential for the development
of robust software applications, diverts focus from the actual problem being
solved. Some of Sciris' key features include: ensuring consistent dictionary,
list, and array types (e.g., enabling users to provide inputs to a class or
method as either lists or arrays); enabling ordered dictionary elements to be
referenced by index; simplifying datetime arithmetic by allowing users to
provide either a date string or a datetime object; simplifying the saving and
loading of files and complex objects; and, simplifying the parallelisation of
common operations. Sciris makes writing scientific code in Python faster,
more pleasant and more readable for a diverse non-specialist audience. This
means that with Sciris users can get more done with less code, without the
need to reinvent the wheel, and spend less time looking things up on
StackOverflow (or the other 20+ tabs with the documentation of every single
library your new application is built upon). Further, Sciris offers an
extension to build webapps in Python: ScirisWeb. In contrast to
[Plotly's Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), which have limited options for customization,
ScirisWeb is modular, so users can control which subset they use for a
project. 

<!-- NOTE: ^^^^ probably need to specify what sort of customisation is lacking in
Streamlit and Dash  -->

The name Sciris, a combination of Scientific + Iris (Greek word for
"rainbow"), thus honors the wide spectrum of tasks commonly required in the
 development of scientific computing applications.

# Statement of need
<!-- 
Need to reduce this section-->
With the increasing availability of large volumes of data and computing
resources, scientists across multiple fields of research have been able to
tackle increasingly complex problems. But to harness these resources, the
need to develop and use domain-specific software has become a ubiquitous part
of scientific projects. Commensurate with the complexity of problems, these
software-related activities have also become increasingly complex, creating a
steep learning curve and an increasing burden of code review
[@burden-codereview]. 

<!-- NOTE: need to find a recent paper where they show survey results of the state of scientific code production, to justify the "large fraction" phrase, I know i read one last year or the year before but i can't remember the authors. or journal. Maybe it was a blog post.  -->
The current reality of scientific code production is that any workflow
(e.g., either a full cycle in the development of a new software library, or
in the execution of a one-off individual analysis) very often relies on
multiple codebases, including but not limited to: low-level libraries;
domain-specific open-source software; and self-developed and/or inherited
swiss-army-knife toolboxes -- whose original developer may or may not be
around to pass on undocumented wisdom. Several scientific communities have
adopted collaborative, community-driven, open-source software approaches due
to the significant savings in development costs and increases in code quality
that they afford [@kerr2019epidemiology] (e.g., astropy
[@robitaille2013astropy], nilearn [@nilearn] and fmriprep
[@esteban2019fmriprep], [HoloViz's libraries](https://holoviz.org)). Despite
this progress, a large fraction of scientific software efforts remain a solo
adventure leading to proliferation of tools where resources have been spent
reinventing the wheel. 

<!-- NOTE: astropy and nilearn get a mention here because of their scale 
and the size of the core dev team. There are other libraries such as seaborn and pingouin that are also open-source projects, but still are heavily developed and maintained by a single developer -->
Scientific software differs from commercial production software in that it is
a crucial component in the elaboration of scientific conclusions, and as such
it should be: re-runnable, repeatable, reproducible, reusable, and
replicable [@benureau2018re]. A key aspect to ensure these properties is
readability of tutorials, documentation and especially of code itself. **But
it is essential to note that low level programming abstractions may not be a great way
to express human-readable scientific ideas or solutions, which is what scientific code
should convey**. For instance, one of the reasons PyTorch has become popular
in academic and in research environments is its success in making models
easier to write compared to TensorFlow [@pytorch-research]. 

The need for libraries that provide "simplifying interfaces" for research
applications is reflected by the development of various notable libraries in
scientific Python ecosystem, that have enabled researchers focus their time
and efforts on solving problems, prototyping solutions, deploying
applications and educating their communities.Some of these include PyTorch,
seaborn[@waskom2021seaborn], DataLad [@halchenko2021datalad], pingouin
[@vallat2018pingouin], hypothesis [@maciver2019hypothesis], Mayavi
[@ramachandran2011mayavi] and PyVista [@sullivan2019pyvista], just to name a
few though there are many more. 

Sciris itself traces its origins to 2014, initially created to support
development of the Optima suite of models[@kerr2015optima]. Among the
existing libraries at the time we had not found one that simplified the
complex semantics of powerful containers or the parallelisation of trivial
yet data-intensive operations. We kept encountering the same
inconveniences over and over while building scientific webapps, and so began
collecting the tools we used to overcome them into a shared library. While
Python was, and still is, considered an easy-to-use language for beginners,
the motivation that shaped Sciris' evolution was to further lower the
barriers to access, interact with, and orchestrate the numerous supporting
libraries we were using. 

For those reasons Sciris provides tools that will result in a more effective
and sustainable scientific code production for solo-developers and teams
alike, and increased longevity [@perkel2020challenge] of new scientific
libraries. Some of the key functional aspects that Sciris provides are:
(i) brevity through simplifying interfaces; (ii) scientific idiomaticity;
(iii)locally scoped forgiving and strict exception handling; and,
(iv) management of versioning information. We expand on each of these in
Overview.

# Example
<!-- (perhaps mention a few of the libraries/dependencies) -->
The Sciris library offers a coordinating interface to multiple well
established and highly flexible Python libraries. Writing a script that
directly uses multiple of these underlying libraries can obscure the key
logic of the scientific problem. Whereas the Sciris interface keeps the focus
on the science.

For instance let us imagine that we want to randomly sample numbers from a
user-defined smooth function. In addition, we want to repeatedly draw numbers
for multiple levels of noise, and save these results in separate files. At a
later stage, we would like to load the independent files, "glue" them
together to reconstruct a surface embedded in 3D by interpolating the random
samples; and finally, we want to plot the random points and surface together.
Parallelizing the repeated draws and customizing the axes to render the 3D
scatter plot plus mesh can be quite cumbersome. \autoref{fig:showcase-code} presents two functionally identical scripts and  highlights that the one written with Sciris is much more succinct and readable:

![Comparison of functionally identical script without Sciris (left) and with Sciris (right). The resulting plot is shown below. \label{fig:showcase-code}](figures/sciris-showcase-code-and-output.png){ width=100% }


# Overview
The current stable version of Sciris (2.0.0) includes implementations of heavily used
code patterns and abstractions that facilitate the development and deployment
of complex domain-specific scientific applications, regardless of their scope
and scale, and further enables non-specialist audiences to interact with
these complex applications. We note that Sciris "stands on the shoulders of giants", and as such is not intended as a replacement of those, but rather as an interface that facilitate a more effective and sustainable development process through:


*Brevity through simplifying interfaces*.

Sciris affords brevity to its users by encapsulating common regular patterns
that span multiple lines of code into a function with a simple interface.
With these functions one can succinctly express and execute (i) frequent
plotting tasks (i.e., `sc.fig3d`, `sc.ax3d`, `sc.hex2rgb`); (ii) less
frequent tasks like pretty printing numeric arrays with up to 3 axes
(e.g., `sc.printarr`) that can be useful for debugging; frequent but less
simple tasks like merging containers (e.g., `sc.mergedicts`,
`sc.mergenested`, `sc.mergelists`), or line-by-line memory profiling (`sc.mprofile`).

Brevity is also achieved by extending functionality of well established
objects (e.g., `OrderedDict` via `sc.odict`) or methods (e.g., `isinstance`
via `sc.checktype` that enables the comparison of objects against
higher-level types like `listlike`) 

<!-- (e.g., one would not include the 'how-to-assemble' manual a spectrophotometer as part of a every report on protein analysis).
 -->
*Scientific idiomaticity*. Sciris promotes uses idiomatic function names (i.e., `sc.smooth`, `sc.findnearest`, `sc.safedivide`) so that the resulting code is as scientifically and human-readable as possible. Further, we note that some of Sciris function names are similar to Matlab's (i.e., `sc.tic` and `sc.toc`). This is 
because there there is often a need to either translate from/to Matlab or R are, or to integrate code components written in multiple languages.

*Forgiving and strict exception handling*.
Across many complex classes and methods, Sciris uses the keyword `die`, enabling users to set a locally scoped level of strictness in the handling of exceptions. If `die=False`, Sciris is more forgiving and softly handles exceptions by using its default (opinionated) behavior. This could be simply printing a message and returning `None` so users can decide how to proceed. If `die=True`, it directly raises the corresponding exception and message. 

*Management of versioning information*.
Keeping track of dates, authors, code version, plus additional notes or
comments is an essential part of scientific projects. Sciris provides methods
to easily save and load metadata to/from figure files, including Git
information (`sc.savefig`, `sc.gitinfo`, `sc.loadmetadata`), but also methods
to compare between two version numbers with any possible combination of an
(in)equality operator (`sc.compareversions`). 


We confirmed our approach with Sciris had paid off when in early 2020 its
combination of brevity and simplicity provided was crucial in: (i) the
faster-than-average development of Covasim
[@kerr2021covasim; @kerr2022python]; and (ii) enabling Covasim to become one
of the most widely adopted COVID models, used by students, researchers and
policy makers alike. In addition to Covasim, Sciris is currently used in a
number of scientific applications
[@kedziora2019cascade; @atomica; @fraser2021using; @hiptool; @synthpops; @parestlib]
and since 2022 has been designated as a critical project on the Python
Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org)).

Documentation can be found at [https://sciris.readthedocs.io](https://sciris.readthedocs.io) with a detailed description on installation
instructions for both [Sciris](https://github.com/sciris/sciris) and

## Key features
Sciris provides class- and function based implementations
of common operations ranging from merging ordered dictionaries, to providing
simplified interfaces to datetime arithmetic, and to limiting the execution
of a program based on resource usage. \autoref{fig:block-diagram} shows the
functional modules of Sciris.

<!-- NOTE: present some key features (a subset of the docs)  
 -->

### Containers 
One of the key features in Sciris is `odict`, a flexible container representing an associative array with the best-of-all-worlds across lists, dictionaries, and numeric arrays. This is based on `OrderedDict` from [`collections`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html), but supports list methods like integer indexing, key slicing, and item inserting.

```Python
> my_odict = sc.odict(foo=[1,2,3], bar=[4,5,6]) 
> my_odict['foo'] == my_odict[0]                
> my_odict[:].sum() == 21                       
> for i, key, value in my_odict.enumitems():    
     print(f'Item {i} is named {key} and has value {value}')
```

### Container methods 

`sc.promotetolist` developed so user-defined functions can handle inputs like ``'a'``  or ``['a', 'b']``. In other words, if an argument
can either be a single thing (e.g., a single dictionary key) or a list (e.g., a list of dictionary keys), this function can be used to do the conversion,
so it is always safe to iterate over the output.

`sc.mergedicts`, by default, skips things that are not dictionaries (e.g., `None`), and allows keys to be set multiple times. The first dictionary supplied will be used for the output type (e.g., if the first dictionary is an `sc.odict`, an `sc.odict` will be returned). This function is useful for cases such as function (keyword) arguments where the default is simply set as `None` but later on a dictionary will be needed.

`sc.flattendict`, flattens a nested dictionary 

```Python
> sc.flattendict({'a':{'b':1,'c':{'d':2,'e':3}}})
{('a', 'b'): 1, ('a', 'c', 'd'): 2, ('a', 'c', 'e'): 3}


> sc.flattendict({'a':{'b':1,'c':{'d':2,'e':3}}}, sep='_')
{'a_b': 1, 'a_c_d': 2, 'a_c_e': 3}
```

### Prettify object/data representations (or how to make stuff more human-readable)

`sc.prettyobj` is a class, used to produce a pretty representation for objects, instead of just showing the type and memory pointer (Python's default for objects). 
```Python
> myobj = sc.prettyobj()
> myobj.a = 3
> myobj.b = {'a':6}
> print(myobj)
<sciris.sc_utils.prettyobj at 0x7ffa1e243910>
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
a: 3
b: {'a': 6}
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
```
This class can also be used as the base class for custom
classes.

```Python
> class MyObj(sc.prettyobj):
>
>     def __init__(self, a, b):
>         self.a = a
>         self.b = b
>
>     def mult(self):
>         return self.a * self.b

> myobj = MyObj(a=4, b=6)
> print(myobj)
<__main__.MyObj at 0x7fd9acd96c10>
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
Methods:
  mult()
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
a: 4
b: 6
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
```

### Don't paint it black  
`sc.vectocolor` converts a 1D array of N values into an Nx3 array
of RGB values according to the current colormap. `sc.arraycolor` extends this functionality to multidimensional arrays. 

### Parallelization
We have found that one frequently hurdle scientists face is to parallelization. Sciris 
provides `sc.parallelize`, which most simply, acts as an shortcut for using `multiprocess.Pool()`. However, importantly this function can also iterate over more complex arguments. It can either use a fixed number of CPUs or allocate dynamically based on load (`sc.loadbalancer`). Users can also specify a fixed number of CPUs to be used. The example below shows three different equivalent ways to iterate over multiple arguments:
```Python
> def f(x,y):
>     return x*y

> results1 = sc.parallelize(func=f, iterarg=[(1,2),(2,3),(3,4)])
> results2 = sc.parallelize(func=f, iterkwargs={'x':[1,2,3], 'y':[2,3,4]})
> results3 = sc.parallelize(func=f, iterkwargs=[{'x':1, 'y':2}, {'x':2, 'y':3}, {'x':3, 'y':4}])

> assert results1 == results2 == results3
```

### Math functionality
`sc.findinds` matches even if two things are not exactly equal 
due to differences in numeric type (e.g., floats vs. integers). 
If called with one argument, finds nonzero values. Called with two arguments,
check for equality using `eps`. The code shown below produces the same result as calling `np.nonzero(np.isclose(arr, val))[0].`

```Python
> sc.findinds([2,3,6,3], 3) 
array([1,3])
```

`sc.asd`: Sciris provides an implementation of the optimization algorithm Adaptive Stochastic dDscent (ASD) described in [@kerr2018optimization], and that has been designed to replicate the essential aspects of manual parameter fitting in an automated way. Specifically, ASD uses simple principles to form probabilistic assumptions about (a) which parameters have the greatest effect on the objective function, and(b) optimal
step sizes for each parameter.

### ScirisWeb
ScirisWeb provides a solution using [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) as the web framework, [Redis](https://redis.io/) for the (optional) database and Matplotlib/[mpld3](https://github.com/mpld3/mpld3) for plotting. ScirisWeb  also enables users to use a React frontend linked to an SQL database with Plotly figures, ScirisWeb can serve as the glue holding all of that together. We note
that ScirisWeb, while functional, is still in beta development.


<!-- NOTE: Take on Cliff's Big Software paper in 2019
  "Third, if a single modeling framework is adopted to the exclusion of other modeling approaches, it limits the potential for gaining insight by comparing across many different models and may result in a â€˜herdâ€™ effect (Eaton et al. 2014).""

Though not sure these concluding remarks are really necessary

As we mentioned before, there are many terrific libraries whose aim is to
provide simpler interfaces to different forms of scientific code across
multiple levels of complexity. Some of these have functionality that overlap
with Sciris, and while that may lead to the unavoidable question "aren't we
reinventing the wheel?", we think that duplication is not always an
undesirable process, as the community of scientific software developers still
has a long way to go to identify clear and universal principles of scientific
code design. --> -->
